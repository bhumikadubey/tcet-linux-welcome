# TCET linux welcome

Tcet Linux Welcome is a simple welcome app specifically written for [TCET Linux](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux) but it can be used on Arch Linux and any Arch-based distributions.

The welcome app aims to provide a easy way to do simple tasks like - 

- Fixing screen resolutions for Vms 
- Updating the packages and mirrors
- Also provides useful links to various resources

The app is written using [YAD](https://github.com/v1cont/yad) and GTK-3.0.
